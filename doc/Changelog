	- detect sign of msghdr.msg_iovlen so that the cast to that type
	  in netevent (which is there to please lint) can be correct.
	  The type on several OSes ranges from int, int32, uint32, size_t.
	  Detects unsigned or signed using math trick.
	- constants for DNS flags. 
	- compilation without locks fixup.
	- removed include of unportable header from lookup3.c.
	- more portable use of struct msghdr.
	- casts for printf warning portability.
	- tweaks to tests to port them to the testbed.
	- 0.2 tag created.

2 April 2007: Wouter
	- check sizes of udp received messages, not too short.
	- review changes. Some memmoves can be memcpys: 4byte aligned.
	  set id correctly on cached answers. 
	- review changes msgreply.c, memleak on error condition. AA flag
	  clear on cached reply. Lowercase queries on hashing.
	  unit test on lowercasing. Test AA bit not set on cached reply.
	  Note that no TTLs are managed.

29 March 2007: Wouter
	- writev or sendmsg used when answering from cache.
	  This avoids a copy of the data.
	- do not do useless byteswap on query id. Store reply flags in uint16
	  for easier access (and no repeated byteswapping).
	- reviewed code.
	- configure detects and config.h includes sys/uio.h for writev decl.

28 March 2007: Wouter
	- new config option: num-queries-per-thread.
	- added tpkg test for answering three queries at the same time
	  using one thread (from the query service list).

27 March 2007: Wouter
	- added test for cache and not cached answers, in testbound replays.
	- testbound can give config file and commandline options from the
	  replay file to unbound.
	- created test that checks if items drop out of the cache.
	- added word 'partitioned hash table' to documentation on slab hash.
	  A slab hash is a partitioned hash table.
	- worker can handle multiple queries at a time.

26 March 2007: Wouter
	- config settings for slab hash message cache.
	- test for cached answer.
	- Fixup deleting fake answer from testbound list.

23 March 2007: Wouter
	- review of yesterday's commits.
	- covered up memory leak of the entry locks.
	- answers from the cache correctly. Copies flags correctly.
	- sanity check for incoming query replies.
	- slabbed hash table. Much nicer contention, need dual cpu to see.

22 March 2007: Wouter
	- AIX configure check.
	- lock-verify can handle references to locks that are created
	  in files it has not yet read in.
	- threaded hash table test. 
	- unit test runs lock-verify afterwards and checks result.
	- need writelock to update data on hash_insert.
	- message cache code, msgreply code.

21 March 2007: Wouter
	- unit test of hash table, fixup locking problem in table_grow().
	- fixup accounting of sizes for removing items from hashtable.
	- unit test for hash table, single threaded test of integrity.
	- lock-verify reports errors nicely. More quiet in operation.

16 March 2007: Wouter
	- lock-verifier, checks consistent order of locking.

14 March 2007: Wouter
	- hash table insert (and subroutines) and lookup implemented.
	- hash table remove.
	- unit tests for hash internal bin, lru functions.

13 March 2007: Wouter
	- lock_unprotect in checklocks.
	- util/storage/lruhash.h for LRU hash table structure.

12 March 2007: Wouter
	- configure.ac moved to 0.2.
	- query_info and replymsg util/data structure.

9 March 2007: Wouter
	- added rwlock writelock checking.
	  So it will keep track of the writelock, and readlocks are enforced
	  to not change protected memory areas.
	- log_hex function to dump hex strings to the logfile.
	- checklocks zeroes its destroyed lock after checking memory areas.
	- unit test for alloc.
	- identifier for union in checklocks to please older compilers.
	- created 0.1 tag.

8 March 2007: Wouter
	- Reviewed checklock code.

7 March 2007: Wouter
	- created a wrapper around thread calls that performs some basic
	  checking for data race and deadlock, and basic performance 
	  contention measurement.

6 March 2007: Wouter
	- Testbed works with threading (different machines, different options).
	- alloc work, does the special type.

2 March 2007: Wouter
	- do not compile fork funcs unless needed. Otherwise will give
	  type errors as their typedefs have not been enabled.
	- log shows thread numbers much more nicely (and portably).
	- even on systems with nonthreadsafe libevent signal handling,
	  unbound will exit if given a signal.
	  Reloads will not work, and exit is not graceful.
	- start of alloc framework layout.

1 March 2007: Wouter
	- Signals, libevent and threads work well, with libevent patch and
	  changes to code (close after event_del).
	- set ipc pipes nonblocking.

27 February 2007: Wouter
	- ub_thread_join portable definition.
	- forking is used if no threading is available.
	  Tested, it works, since pipes work across processes as well.
	  Thread_join is replaced with waitpid. 
	- During reloads the daemon will temporarily handle signals,
	  so that they do not result in problems.
	- Also randomize the outgoing port range for tests.
	- If query list is full, will stop selecting listening ports for read.
	  This makes all threads service incoming requests, instead of one.
	  No memory is leaking during reloads, service of queries, etc.
	- test that uses ldns-testns -f to test threading. Have to answer
	  three queries at the same time.
	- with verbose=0 operates quietly.

26 February 2007: Wouter
	- ub_random code used to select ID and port.
	- log code prints thread id.
	- unbound can thread itself, with reload(HUP) and quit working
	  correctly.
	- don't open pipes for #0, doesn't need it.
	- listens to SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT (all quit) and SIGHUP (reload).

23 February 2007: Wouter
	- Can do reloads on sigHUP. Everything is stopped, and freed,
	  except the listening ports. Then the config file is reread.
	  And everything is started again (and listening ports if needed).
	- Ports for queries are shared.
	- config file added interface:, chroot: and username:.
	- config file: directory, logfile, pidfile. And they work too.
	- will daemonize by default now. Use -d to stay in the foreground.
	- got BSD random[256 state] code, made it threadsafe. util/random.

22 February 2007: Wouter
	- Have a config file. Removed commandline options, moved to config.
	- tests use config file.

	- put -c option in man page.
	- minievent fd array capped by FD_SETSIZE.

20 February 2007: Wouter

	- added yacc and lex configure, and config file parsing code.
	  also makedist.sh, and manpage.
	- put include errno.h in config.h

19 February 2007: Wouter
	- Created 0.0 svn tag.
	- added acx_pthread.m4 autoconf check for pthreads from 
	  the autoconf archive. It is GPL-with-autoconf-exception Licensed.
	  You can specify --with-pthreads, or --without-pthreads to configure.

16 February 2007: Wouter
	- Updated testbed script, works better by using make on remote end.
	- removed check decls, we can compile without them.
	- makefile supports LIBOBJ replacements.
	- docs checks ignore compat code.
	- added util/mini-event.c and .h, a select based alternative used with
	  ./configure --with-libevent=no
	  It is limited to 1024 file descriptors, and has less features.
	- will not create ip6 sockets if ip6 not on the machine.

15 February 2007: Wouter
	- port to FreeBSD 4.11 Dec Alpha. Also works on Solaris 10 sparc64,
	  Solaris 9, FreeBSD 6, Linux i386 and OSX powerpc.
	- malloc rndstate, so that it is aligned for access.
	- fixed rbtree cleanup with postorder traverse.
	- fixed pending messages are deleted when handled.
	- You can control verbosity; default is not verbose, every -v
	  adds more verbosity.

14 February 2007: Wouter
	- Included configure.ac changes from ldns.
	- detect (some) headers before the standards check.
	- do not use isblank to test c99, since its not available on solaris9.
	- review of testcode.
		* entries in a RANGE are no longer reversed.
		* print name of file with replay entry parse errors.
	- port to OSX: cast to int for some prints of sizet.
	- Makefile copies ldnstestpkts.c before doing dependencies on it.

13 February 2007: Wouter

	- work on fake events.

9 February 2007: Wouter
	- replay file reading.

	- replay storage.
	- testcode/fake_event work.

7 February 2007: Wouter
	- return answer with the same ID as query was sent with.
	- created udp forwarder test. I've done some effort to make it perform
	  quickly. After servers are created, no big sleep statements but
	  it checks the logfiles to see if servers have come up. Takes 0.14s.
	- set addrlen value when calling recvfrom.
	- comparison of addrs more portable.
	- LIBEVENT option for testbed to set libevent directory.
