	- streamtcp can use UDP mode (connected UDP socket), for testing IPv6
	  on windows.
	- fwd_ancil test fails if platform support is lacking.

23 June 2008: Wouter
	- fixup minitpkg to cleanup on windows with its file locking troubles.
	- minitpkg shows skipped tests in report.
	- skip ipv6 tests on ipv4 only hosts (requires only ipv6 localhost not
	  ipv6 connectivity).
	- winsock event handler keeps track of sticky TCP events, that have
	  not been fully handled yet. when interest in the event(s) resumes,
	  they are sent again. When WOULDBLOCK is returned events are cleared.
	- skip tests that need signals when testing on mingw.

18 June 2008: Wouter
	- open testbound replay files in binary mode, because fseek/ftell
	  do not work in ascii-mode on windows. The b does nothing on unix.
	  unittest and testbound tests work on windows (xp too).
	- ioctlsocket prints nicer error message.
	- fixed up some TCP porting for winsock.
	- lack of IPv6 gives a warning, no fatal error.
	- use WSAGetLastError() on windows instead of errno for some errors.

17 June 2008: Wouter
	- outgoing num fds 32 by default on windows ; it supports less
	  fds for waiting on than unixes.
	- winsock_event minievent handler for windows. (you could also
	  attempt to link with libevent/libev ports for windows).
	- neater crypto check and gdi32 detection.

	- if no threading, THREADS_DISABLED is defined for use in the code.
	- sets USE_WINSOCK if using ws2_32 on windows.
	- wsa_strerror() function for more readable errors.
	- WSA Startup and Cleanup called in unbound.exe.

13 June 2008: Wouter
	- port mingw32, more signal ifdefs, detect sleep, usleep, 
	  random, srandom (used inside the tests).
	- signed or unsigned FD_SET is cast.

10 June 2008: Wouter
	- fixup warnings compiling on eeepc xandros linux.

9 June 2008: Wouter
	- in iteration response type code
	  * first check for SOA record (negative answer) before NS record
	    and lameness.
	  * check if no AA bit for non-forwarder, and thus lame zone.
	    In response to error report by Richard Doty for mail.opusnet.com.
	- fixup unput warning from lexer on freeBSD.
	- bug#183. pidfile, rundir, and chroot configure options. Also the
	  example.conf and manual pages get the configured defaults.
	  You can use: (or accept the defaults to /usr/local/etc/unbound/)
	  --with-conf-file=filename
	  --with-pidfile=filename
	  --with-run-dir=path
	  --with-chroot-dir=path

8 June 2008: Wouter

	- updated libtool files with newer version.
	- iana portlist updated.

3 June 2008: Wouter
	- fixup local-zone: "30.172.in-addr.arpa." nodefault, so that the
	  trailing dot is not used during comparison.

2 June 2008: Wouter
	- Jelte fixed bugs in my absence
	  - bug 178: fixed unportable shell usage in configure (relied on 
	    bash shell).
	  - bug 180: fixed buffer overflow in unbound-checkconf use of strncat.
	  - bug 181: fixed buffer overflow in ldns (called by unbound to parse
	    config file parts).
	- fixes by Wouter
	  - bug 177: fixed compilation failure on opensuse, the 
	    --disable-static configure flag caused problems.  (Patch from 
	    Klaus Singvogel)
	  - bug 179: same fix as 177.
	  - bug 185: --disable-shared not passed along to ldns included with 
	    unbound. Fixed so that configure parameters are passed to the
	    subdir configure script.
	    fixed that ./libtool is used always, you can still override
	    manually with ./configure libtool=mylibtool or set $libtool in
	    the environment.
	- update of the ldns tarball to current ldns svn version (fix 181).
	- bug 184: -r option for unbound-host, read resolv.conf for 
	  forwarder. (Note that forwarder must support DNSSEC for validation
	  to succeed).

23 May 2008: Wouter
	- mingw32 porting.
	  - test for sys/wait.h
	  - WSAEWOULDBLOCK test after nonblocking TCP connect.

	- sunos4 porting changes.

15 April 2008: Wouter

	- iana ports updated.
	- copyright updated in ldns-testpkts to keep same as in ldns.
	- fixup checkconf chroot tests a bit more, chdir must be inside
	  chroot dir.
	- documented 'gcc: unrecognized -KPIC option' errors on Solaris.
	- example.conf values changed to /usr/local/etc/unbound
	- DSA test work.
	- DSA signatures: unbound is compatible with both encodings found.
	  It will detect and convert when necessary.

14 April 2008: Wouter
	- got update for parseunbound.pl statistics script from Kai Storbeck.
	- tpkg tests for udp wait list.
	- documented 0x20 status.
	- fixup chroot and checkconf, it is much smarter now.
	- fixup DSA EVP signature decoding. Solution that Jelte found copied.
	- and check first sig byte for the encoding type.

11 April 2008: Wouter
	- random port selection out of the configged ports.
	- fixup threadsafety for libevent-1.4.3+ (event_base_get_method).
	- removed base_port.
	- created 256-port ephemeral space for the OS, 59802 available.
	- fixup consistency of port_if out array during heavy use.

10 April 2008: Wouter
	- --with-libevent works with latest libevent 1.4.99-trunk.
	- added log file statistics perl script to contrib.
	- automatic iana ports update from makefile. 60058 available.

9 April 2008: Wouter
	- configure can detect libev(from its build directory) when passed
	  --with-libevent=/home/wouter/libev-3.2
	  libev-3.2 is a little faster than libevent-1.4.3-stable (about 5%).
	- unused commpoints not listed in epoll list.
	- statistics-cumulative option so that the values are not reset.
	- config creates array of available ports, 61841 available,
	  it excludes <1024 and iana assigned numbers.
	  config statements to modify the available port numbers.

8 April 2008: Wouter
	- unbound tries to set the ulimit fds when started as server.
	  if that does not work, it will scale back its requirements.

27 March 2008: Wouter
	- documented /dev/random symlink from chrootdir as FAQ entry.

26 March 2008: Wouter
	- implemented AD bit signaling. If a query sets AD bit (but not DO)
	  then the AD bit is set in the reply if the answer validated.
	  Without including DNSSEC signatures. Useful if you have a trusted
	  path from the client to the resolver. Follows dnssec-updates draft.

25 March 2008: Wouter
	- implemented check that for NXDOMAIN and NOERROR answers a query
	  section must be present in the reply (by the scrubber). And it must
	  be equal to the question sent, at least lowercase folded.
	  Previously this feature happened because the cache code refused
	  to store such messages. However blocking by the scrubber makes 
	  sure nothing gets into the RRset cache. Also, this looks like a
	  timeout (instead of an allocation failure) and this retries are
	  done (which is useful in a spoofing situation).
	- RTT banding. Band size 400 msec, this makes band around zero (fast)
	  include unknown servers. This makes unbound explore unknown servers.

7 March 2008: Wouter
	- -C config feature for harvest program. 
	- harvest handles CNAMEs too.

5 March 2008: Wouter
	- patch from Hugo Koji Kobayashi for iterator logs spelling.

4 March 2008: Wouter
	- From report by Jinmei Tatuya, rfc2181 trust value for remainder
	  of a cname trust chain is lower; not full answer_AA. 
	- test for this fix.
	- default config file location is /usr/local/etc/unbound.
	  Thus prefix is used to determine the location. This is also the
	  chroot and pidfile default location.

3 March 2008: Wouter
	- Create 0.10 svn tag.
	- 0.11 version in trunk.
	- indentation nicer.

29 February 2008: Wouter
	- documentation update.
	- fixup port to Solaris of perf test tool.
	- updated ldns-tarball with decl-after-statement fixes.

28 February 2008: Wouter
	- fixed memory leaks in libunbound (during cancellation and wait).
	- libunbound returns the answer packet in full.
	- snprintf compat update.
	- harvest performs lookup.
	- ldns-tarball update with fix for ldns_dname_label.
	- installs to sbin by default.
	- install all manual pages (unbound-host and libunbound too).

27 February 2008: Wouter
	- option to use caps for id randomness.
	- config file option use-caps-for-id: yes
	- harvest debug tool

26 February 2008: Wouter
	- delay utility delays TCP as well. If the server that is forwarded 
	  to has a TCP error, the delay utility closes the connection.
	- delay does REUSE_ADDR, and can handle a server that closes its end.
	- answers use casing from query.

25 February 2008: Wouter
	- delay utility works. Gets decent thoughput too (>20000).

22 February 2008: Wouter
	- +2% for recursions, if identical queries (except for destination
	  and query ID) in the reply list, avoid re-encoding the answer.
	- removed TODO items for optimizations that do not show up in
	  profile reports.
	- default is now minievent - not libevent. As its faster and
	  not needed for regular installs, only for very large port ranges.
	- loop check different speedup pkt-dname-reading, 1% faster for
	  nocache-recursion check.
	- less hashing during msg parse, 4% for recursion.
	- small speed fix for dname_count_size_labels, +1 or +2% recursion.
	- some speed results noted:
	  optimization resulted in +40% for recursion (cache miss) and
	  +70 to +80 for cache hits, and +96% for version.bind.
	  zone nsec3 example, 100 NXDOMAIN queries, NSD 35182.8 Ub 36048.4
	  www.nlnetlabs.nl from cache: BIND 8987.99 Ub 31218.3
	  www with DO bit set : BIND 8269.31 Ub 28735.6 qps.
	  So, unbound can be about equal qps to NSD in cache hits.
	  And about 3.4x faster than BIND in cache performance.
	- delay utility for testing.

21 February 2008: Wouter
	- speedup of root-delegation message encoding by 15%.
	- minor speedup of compress tree_lookup, maybe 1%.
	- speedup of dname_lab_cmp and memlowercmp - the top functions in 
	  profiler output, maybe a couple percent when it matters.

20 February 2008: Wouter
	- setup speec_cache for need-ldns-testns in dotests.
	- check number of queued replies on incoming queries to avoid overload
	  on that account.
	- fptr whitelist checks are not disabled in optimize mode.
	- do-daemonize config file option.
	- minievent time share initializes time at start.
	- updated testdata for nsec3 new algorithm numbers (6, 7).
	- small performance test of packet encoding (root delegation).

19 February 2008: Wouter
	- applied patch to unbound-host man page from Jan-Piet Mens.
	- fix donotquery-localhost: yes default (it erroneously was switched
	  to default 'no').
	- time is only gotten once and the value is shared across unbound.
	- unittest cleans up crypto, so that it has no memory leaks.
	- mini_event shares the time value with unbound this results in 
	  +3% speed for cache responses and +9% for recursions.
	- ldns tarball update with new NSEC3 sign code numbers.
	- perform several reads per UDP operation. This improves performance
	  in DoS conditions, and costs very little in normal conditions.
	  improves cache response +50%, and recursions +10%.
	- modified asynclook test. because the callback from async is not
	  in any sort of lock (and thus can use all library functions freely),
	  this causes a tiny race condition window when the last lock is 
	  released for a callback and a new cancel() for that callback.
	  The only way to remove this is by putting callbacks into some 
	  lock window. I'd rather have the small possibility of a callback
	  for a cancelled function then no use of library functions in 
	  callbacks. Could be possible to only outlaw process(), wait(),
	  cancel() from callbacks, by adding another lock, but I'd rather not.

18 February 2008: Wouter
	- patch to unbound-host from Jan-Piet Mens.
	- unbound host prints errors if fails to configure context.
	- fixup perf to resend faster, so that long waiting requests do
	  not hold up the queue, they become lost packets or SERVFAILs,
	  or can be sent a little while later (i.e. processing time may 
	  take long, but throughput has to be high).
	- fixup iterator operating in no cache conditions (RD flag unset
	  after a CNAME).
	- streamlined code for RD flag setting.
	- profiled code and changed dname compares to be faster. 
	  The speedup is about +3% to +8% (depending on the test).
	- minievent tests for eintr and eagain.

15 February 2008: Wouter
	- added FreeBSD rc.d script to contrib.
	- --prefix option for configure also changes directory: pidfile:
	  and chroot: defaults in config file.
	- added cache speed test, for cache size OK and cache too small.

14 February 2008: Wouter
	- start without a config file (will complain, but start with
	  defaults).
	- perf test program works.

13 February 2008: Wouter
	- 0.9 released.
	- 1.0 development. Printout ldns version on unbound -h.
	- start of perf tool.
	- bugfix to read empty lines from /etc/hosts.

12 February 2008: Wouter
	- fixup problem with configure calling itself if ldns-src tarball
	  is not present.

11 February 2008: Wouter
	- changed library to use ub_ instead of ub_val_ as prefix.
	- statistics output text nice.
	- etc/hosts handling.
	- library function to put logging to a stream.
	- set any option interface.

8 February 2008: Wouter
	- test program for multiple queries over a TCP channel.
	- tpkg test for stream tcp queries.
	- unbound replies to multiple TCP queries on a TCP channel.
	- fixup misclassification of root referral with NS in answer
	  when validating a nonrec query.
	- tag 0.9
	- layout of manpages, spelling fix in header, manpages process by
	  makedist, list asynclook and tcpstream tests as ldns-testns
	  required.

7 February 2008: Wouter
	- moved up all current level 2 to be level 3. And 3 to 4.
	  to make room for new debug level 2 for detailed information 
	  for operators.
	- verbosity level 2. Describes recursion and validation.
	- cleaner configure script and fixes for libevent solaris.
	- signedness for log output memory sizes in high verbosity.

6 February 2008: Wouter
	- clearer explanation of threading configure options.
	- fixup asynclook test for nothreading (it creates only one process
	  to do the extended test).
	- changed name of ub_val_result_free to ub_val_resolve_free.
	- removes warning message during library linking, renamed
	  libunbound/unbound.c -> libunbound.c and worker to libworker.
	- fallback without EDNS if result is NOTIMPL as well as on FORMERR.

5 February 2008: Wouter
	- statistics-interval: seconds option added.
	- test for statistics option
	- ignore errors making directories, these can occur in parallel builds
	- fixup Makefile strip command and libunbound docs typo.

31 January 2008: Wouter
	- bg thread/process reads and writes the pipe nonblocking all the time
	  so that even if the pipe is buffered or so, the bg thread does not
	  block, and services both pipes and queries.

30 January 2008: Wouter
	- check trailing / on chrootdir in checkconf.
	- check if root hints and anchor files are in chrootdir.
	- no route to host tcp error is verbosity level 2. 
	- removed unused send_reply_iov. and its configure check.
	- added prints of 'remote address is 1.2.3.4 port 53' to errors
	  from netevent; the basic socket errors.

28 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup uninit use of buffer by libunbound (query id, flags) for
	  local_zone answers.
	- fixup uninit warning from random.c; also seems to fix sporadic
	  sigFPE coming out of openssl.
	- made openssl entropy warning more silent for library use. Needs
	  verbosity 1 now.
	- fixup forgotten locks for rbtree_searches on ctx->query tree.
	- random generator cleanup - RND_STATE_SIZE removed, and instead
	  a super-rnd can be passed at init to chain init random states.
	- test also does lock checks if available.
	- protect config access in libworker_setup().
	- libevent doesn't like comm_base_exit outside of runloop.
	- close fds after removing commpoints only (for epoll, kqueue).

25 January 2008: Wouter
	- added tpkg for asynclook and library use. 
	- allows localhost to be queried when as a library.
	- fixup race condition between cancel and answer (in case of
	  really fast answers that beat the cancel).
	- please doxygen, put doxygen comment in one place.
	- asynclook -b blocking mode and test.
	- refactor asynclook, nicer code.
	- fixup race problems from opensll in rand init from library, with
	  a mutex around the rand init.
	- fix pass async_id=NULL to _async resolve().
	- rewrote _wait() routine, so that it is threadsafe.
	- cancelation is threadsafe.
	- asynclook extended test in tpkg.
	- fixed two races where forked bg process waits for (somehow shared?)
	  locks, so does not service the query pipe on the bg side.
	  Now those locks are only held for fg_threads and for bg_as_a_thread.

24 January 2008: Wouter
	- tested the cancel() function.
	- asynclook -c (cancel) feature.
	- fix fail to allocate context actions.
	- make pipe nonblocking at start.
	- update plane for retry mode with caution to limit bandwidth.
	- fix Makefile for concurrent make of unbound-host.
	- renamed ub_val_ctx_wait/poll/process/fd to ub_val*.
	- new calls to set forwarding added to header and docs.

23 January 2008: Wouter
	- removed debug prints from if-auto, verb-algo enables some.
	- libunbound QUIT setup, remove memory leaks, when using threads
	  will share memory for passing results instead of writing it over
	  the pipe, only writes ID number over the pipe (towards the handler
	  thread that does process() ).

22 January 2008: Wouter
	- library code for async in libunbound/unbound.c.
	- fix link testbound.
	- fixup exit bug in mini_event.
	- background worker query enter and result functions.
	- bg query test application asynclook, it looks up multiple
	  hostaddresses (A records) at the same time.

21 January 2008: Wouter
	- libworker work, netevent raw commpoints, write_msg, serialize.

18 January 2008: Wouter
	- touch up of manpage for libunbound.
	- support for IP_RECVDSTADDR (for *BSD ip4).
	- fix for BSD, do not use ip4to6 mapping, make two sockets, once
	  ip6 and once ip4, uses socket options.
	- goodbye ip4to6 mapping.
	- update ldns-testpkts with latest version from ldns-trunk.
	- updated makedist for relative ldns pathnames.
	- library API with more information inside the result structure.
	- work on background resolves.

17 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup configure in case -lldns is installed.
	- fixup a couple of doxygen warnings, about enum variables.
	- interface-automatic now copies the interface address from the
	  PKT_INFO structure as well.
	- manual page with library API, all on one page 'man libunbound'.
	- rewrite of PKTINFO structure, it also captures IP4 PKTINFO.

16 January 2008: Wouter
	- incoming queries to the server with TC bit on are replied FORMERR.
	- interface-automatic replied the wrong source address on localhost
	  queries. Seems to be due to ifnum=0 in recvmsg PKTINFO. Trying
	  to use ifnum=-1 to mean 'no interface, use kernel route'.

15 January 2008: Wouter
	- interface-automatic feature. experimental. Nice for anycast.
	- tpkg test for ip6 ancillary data.
	- removed debug prints.
	- porting experience, define for Solaris, test refined for BSD
	  compatibility. The feature probably will not work on OpenBSD.
	- makedist fixup for ldns-src in build-dir.

14 January 2008: Wouter
	- in no debug sets NDEBUG to remove asserts.
	- configure --enable-debug is needed for dependency generation
	  for assertions and for compiler warnings.
	- ldns.tgz updated with ldns-trunk (where buffer.h is updated).
	- fix lint, unit test in optimize mode.
	- default access control allows ::ffff:127.0.0.1 v6mapped localhost.
	
11 January 2008: Wouter
	- man page, warning removed.
	- added text describing the use of stub zones for private zones.
	- checkconf tests for bad hostnames (IP address), and for doubled
	  interface lines.
	- memory sizes can be given with 'k', 'Kb', or M or G appended.

10 January 2008: Wouter
	- typo in example.conf.
	- made using ldns-src that is included the package more portable
	  by linking with .lo instead of .o files in the ldns package.
	- nicer do-ip6: yes/no documentation.
	- nicer linking of libevent .o files.
	- man pages render correctly on solaris.

9 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup openssl RAND problem, when the system is not configured to
	  give entropy, and the rng needs to be seeded.

8 January 2008: Wouter
	- print median and quartiles with extensive logging.

4 January 2008: Wouter
	- document misconfiguration in private network.

2 January 2008: Wouter
	- fixup typo in requirements.
	- document that 'refused' is a better choice than 'drop' for 
	  the access control list, as refused will stop retries.

7 December 2007: Wouter
	- unbound-host has a -d option to show what happens. This can help
	  with debugging (why do I get this answer).
	- fixup CNAME handling, on nodata, sets and display canonname.
	- dot removed from CNAME display.
	- respect -v for NXDOMAINs.
	- updated ldns-src.tar.gz with ldns-trunk today (1.2.2 fixes).
	- size_t to int for portability of the header file.
	- fixup bogus handling.
	- dependencies and lint for unbound-host.

6 December 2007: Wouter
	- library resolution works in foreground mode, unbound-host app
	  receives data.
	- unbound-host prints rdata using ldns.
	- unbound-host accepts trust anchors, and prints validation
	  information when you give -v.

5 December 2007: Wouter
	- locking in context_new() inside the function.
	- setup of libworker.

4 December 2007: Wouter
	- minor Makefile fixup.
	- moved module-stack code out of daemon/daemon into services/modstack,
	  preparing for code-reuse.
	- move context into own header file.
	- context query structure.
	- removed unused variable pwd from checkconf.
	- removed unused assignment from outside netw.
	- check timeval length of string.
	- fixup error in val_utils getsigner.
	- fixup same (*var) error in netblocktostr.
	- fixup memleak on parse error in localzone.
	- fixup memleak on packet parse error.
	- put ; after union in parser.y.
	- small hardening in iter_operate against iq==NULL.
	- hardening, if error reply with rcode=0 (noerror) send servfail.
	- fixup same (*var) error in find_rrset in msgparse, was harmless.
	- check return value of evtimer_add().
	- fixup lockorder in lruhash_reclaim(), building up a list of locked
	  entries one at a time. Instead they are removed and unlocked.
	- fptr_wlist for markdelfunc.
	- removed is_locked param from lruhash delkeyfunc.
	- moved bin_unlock during bin_split purely to please.

3 December 2007: Wouter
	- changed checkconf/ to smallapp/ to make room for more support tools.
	  (such as unbound-host).
	- install dirs created with -m 755 because they need to be accessible.
	- library extensive featurelist added to TODO.
	- please doxygen, lint.
	- library test application, with basic functionality.
	- fix for building in a subdirectory. 
	- link lib fix for Leopard.

30 November 2007: Wouter
	- makefile that creates libunbound.la, basic file or libunbound.a
	  when creating static executables (no libtool).
	- more API setup.

29 November 2007: Wouter
	- 0.9 public API start.

28 November 2007: Wouter
	- Changeup plan for 0.8 - no complication needed, a simple solution
	  has been chosen for authoritative features.
	- you can use single quotes in the config file, so it is possible
	  to specify TXT records in local data.
	- fixup small memory problem in implicit transparent zone creation.
	- test for implicit zone creation and multiple RR RRsets local data.
	- local-zone nodefault test.
	- show testbound testlist on commit.
	- iterator normalizer changes CNAME chains ending in NXDOMAIN where
	  the packet got rcode NXDOMAIN into rcode NOERROR. (since the initial
	  domain exists).
	- nicer verbosity: 0 and 1 levels.
	- lower nonRDquery chance of eliciting wrongly typed validation
	  requiring message from the cache.
	- fix for nonRDquery validation typing; nodata is detected when
	  SOA record in auth section (all validation-requiring nodata messages
	  have a SOA record in authority, so this is OK for the validator),
	  and NS record is needed to be a referral.
	- duplicate checking when adding NSECs for a CNAME, and test.
	- created svn tag 0.8, after completing testbed tests.

27 November 2007: Wouter
	- per suggestion in rfc2308, replaced default max-ttl value with 1 day.
	- set size of msgparse lookup table to 32, from 1024, so that its size
	  is below the 2048 regional large size threshold, and does not cause
	  a call to malloc when a message is parsed.
	- update of memstats tool to print number of allocation calls.
	  This is what is taking time (not space) and indicates the avg size
	  of the allocations as well. region_alloc stat is removed.

22 November 2007: Wouter
	- noted EDNS in-the-middle dropping trouble as a TODO.
	  At this point theoretical, no user trouble has been reported.
	- added all default AS112 zones.
	- answers from local zone content.
		* positive answer, the rrset in question
		* nodata answer (exist, but not that type).
		* nxdomain answer (domain does not exist).
		* empty-nonterminal answer.
		* But not: wildcard, nsec, referral, rrsig, cname/dname,
			or additional section processing, NS put in auth.
	- test for correct working of static and transparent and couple
	  of important defaults (localhost, as112, reverses). 
	  Also checks deny and refuse settings.
	- fixup implicit zone generation and AA bit for NXDOMAIN on localdata.

21 November 2007: Wouter
	- local zone internal data setup.

20 November 2007: Wouter
	- 0.8 - str2list config support for double string config options.
	- local-zone and local-data options, config storage and documentation.

19 November 2007: Wouter
	- do not downcase NSEC and RRSIG for verification. Follows 
	  draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-bis-updates-06.txt.
	- fixup leaking unbound daemons at end of tests.
	- README file updated.
	- nice libevent not found error.
	- README talks about gnu make.
	- 0.8: unit test for addr_mask and fixups for it.
	  and unit test for addr_in_common().
	- 0.8: access-control config file element.
	  and unit test rpl replay file.
	- 0.8: fixup address reporting from netevent.

16 November 2007: Wouter
	- privilege separation is not needed in unbound at this time.
	  TODO item marked as such.
	- created beta-0.7 branch for support.
	- tagged 0.7 for beta release.
	- moved trunk to 0.8 for 0.8(auth features) development.
	- 0.8: access control list setup.

15 November 2007: Wouter
	- review fixups from Jelte.

14 November 2007: Wouter
	- testbed script does not recreate configure, since its in svn now.
	- fixup checkconf test so that it does not test 
	  /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.
	- tag 0.6.

13 November 2007: Wouter
	- remove debug print.
	- fixup testbound exit when LIBEVENT_SIGNAL_PROBLEM exists.

12 November 2007: Wouter
	- fixup signal handling where SIGTERM could be ignored if a SIGHUP
	  arrives later on.
	- bugreports to unbound-bugs@nlnetlabs.nl
	- fixup testbound so it exits cleanly.
	- cleanup the caches on a reload, so that rrsetID numbers won't clash.

9 November 2007: Wouter
	- took ldns snapshot in repo.
	- default config file is /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.
	  If it doesn't exist, it is installed with the doc/example.conf file.
	  The file is not deleted on uninstall.
	- default listening is not all, but localhost interfaces.
	
8 November 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup chroot and drop user privileges.
	- new L root ip address in default hints.

1 November 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup of crash on reload, due to anchors in env not NULLed after
	  dealloc during deinit.
	- Fixup of chroot call. Happens after privileges are dropped, so
	  that checking the passwd entry still works.
	- minor touch up of clear() hashtable function.
	- VERB_DETAIL prints out what chdir, username, chroot is being done.
	- when id numbers run out, caches are cleared, as in design notes.
	  Tested with a mock setup with very few bits in id, it worked.
	- harden-dnssec-stripped: yes is now default. It insists on dnssec
	  data for trust anchors. Included tests for the feature.

31 October 2007: Wouter
	- cache-max-ttl config option.
	- building outside sourcedir works again.
	- defaults more secure:
		username: "unbound"
		chroot: "/etc/unbound"
	  The operator can override them to be less secure ("") if necessary.
	- fix horrible oversight in sorting rrset references in a message,
	  sort per reference key pointer, not on referencepointer itself.
	- pidfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.pid" is now the default.
	- tests changed to reflect the updated default.
	- created hashtable clear() function that respects locks.

30 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup assertion failure that relied on compressed names to be
	  smaller than uncompressed names. A packet from comrite.com was seen
	  to be compressed to a larger size. Added it as unit test.
	- quieter logging at low verbosity level for common tcp messages.
	- no greedy TTL update.

23 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup (grand-)parent problem for dnssec-lameness detection.
	- fixup tests to do additional section processing for lame replies,
	  since the detection needs that.
	- no longer trust in query section in reply during dnssec lame detect.
	- dnssec lameness does not make the server never ever queried, but
	  non-preferred. If no other servers exist or answer, the dnssec lame
	  server is used; the fastest dnssec lame server is chosen.
	- added test then when trust anchor cannot be primed (nodata), the
	  insecure mode from unbound works.
	- Fixup max queries per thread, any more are dropped.

22 October 2007: Wouter
	- added donotquerylocalhost config option. Can be turned off for
	  out test cases.
	- ISO C compat changes.
	- detect RA-no-AA lameness, as LAME.
	- DNSSEC-lameness detection, as LAME.
	  See notes in requirements.txt for choices made.
	- tests for lameness detection.
	- added all to make test target; need unbound for fwd tests.
	- testbound does not pollute /etc/unbound.

19 October 2007: Wouter
	- added configure (and its files) to svn, so that the trunk is easier
	  to use. ./configure, config.guess, config.sub, ltmain.sh,
	  and config.h.in.
	- added yacc/lex generated files, util/configlexer.c, 
	  util/configparser.c util/configparser.h, to svn. 
	- without lex no attempt to use it.
	- unsecure response validation collated into one block.
	- remove warning about const cast of cfgfile name.
	- outgoing-interfaces can be different from service interfaces.
	- ldns-src configure is done during unbound configure and
	  ldns-src make is done during unbound make, and so inherits the
	  make arguments from the unbound make invocation.
	- nicer error when libevent problem causes instant exit on signal.
	- read root hints from a root hint file (like BIND does).
	  
18 October 2007: Wouter
	- addresses are logged with errors.
	- fixup testcode fake event to remove pending before callback
	  since the callback may create new pending items.
	- tests updated because retries are now in iterator module.
	- ldns-testpkts code is checked for differences between unbound
	  and ldns by makedist.sh.
	- ldns trunk from today added in svn repo for fallback in case
	  no ldns is installed on the system.
	  make download_ldns refreshes the tarball with ldns svn trunk.
	- ldns-src.tar.gz is used if no ldns is found on the system, and
	  statically linked into unbound.
	- start of regional allocator code.
	- regional uses less memory and variables, simplified code.
	- remove of region-allocator.
	- alloc cache keeps a cache of recently released regional blocks,
	  up to a maximum.
	- make unit test cleanly free memory.

17 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup another cycle detect and ns-addr timeout resolution bug.
	  This time by refusing delegations from the cache without addresses
	  when resolving a mandatory-glue nameserver-address for that zone.
	  We're going to have to ask a TLD server anyway; might as well be
	  the TLD server for this name. And this resolves a lot of cases where
	  the other nameserver names lead to cycles or are not available.
	- changed random generator from random(3) clone to arc4random wrapped
	  for thread safety. The random generator is initialised with
	  entropy from the system.
	- fix crash where failure to prime DNSKEY tried to print null pointer
	  in the log message.
	- removed some debug prints, only verb_algo (4) enables them.
	- fixup test; new random generator took new paths; such as one 
	  where no scripted answer was available.
	- mark insecure RRs as insecure.
	- fixup removal of nonsecure items from the additional.
	- reduced timeout values to more realistic, 376 msec (262 msec has
	  90% of roundtrip times, 512 msec has 99% of roundtrip times.)
	- server selection failover to next server after timeout (376 msec).

16 October 2007: Wouter
	- no malloc in log_hex.
	- assertions around system calls.
	- protect against gethostname without ending zero.
	- ntop output is null terminated by unbound.
	- pidfile content null termination
	- various snprintf use sizeof(stringbuf) instead of fixed constant.
	- changed loopdetect % 8 with & 0x7 since % can become negative for
	  weird negative input and particular interpretation of integer math.
	- dname_pkt_copy checks length of result, to protect result buffers.
	  prints an error, this should not happen. Bad strings should have
	  been rejected earlier in the program.
	- remove a size_t underflow from msgreply size func.

15 October 2007: Wouter
	- nicer warning.
	- fix IP6 TCP, wrong definition check. With test package.
	- fixup the fact that the query section was not compressed to,
	  the code was there but was called by value instead of by reference.
	  And test for the case, uses xxd and nc.
	- more portable ip6 check for sockaddr types.

8 October 2007: Wouter
	- --disable-rpath option in configure for 64bit systems with
	  several dynamic lib dirs.

7 October 2007: Wouter
	- fixup tests for no AD bit in non-DO queries.
	- test that makes sure AD bit is not set on non-DO query.

6 October 2007: Wouter
	- removed logfile open early. It did not have the proper permissions;
	  it was opened as root instead of the user. And we cannot change user
	  id yet, since chroot and bind ports need to be done.
	- callback checks for event callbacks done from mini_event. Because
	  of deletions cannot do this from netevent. This means when using
	  libevent the protection does not work on event-callbacks.
	- fixup too small reply (did not zero counts).
	- fixup reply no longer AD bit when query without DO bit.

5 October 2007: Wouter
	- function pointer whitelist.

4 October 2007: Wouter
	- overwrite sensitive random seed value after use.
	- switch to logfile very soon if not -d (console attached).
	- error messages do not reveal the trustanchor contents.
	- start work on function pointer whitelists.

3 October 2007: Wouter
	- fix for multiple empty nonterminals, after multiple DSes in the
	  chain of trust.
	- mesh checks if modules are looping, and stops them.
	- refetch with CNAMEd nameserver address regression test added.
	- fixup line count bug in testcode, so testbound prints correct line
	  number with parse errors.
	- unit test for multiple ENT case.
	- fix for cname out of validated unsec zone.
	- fixup nasty id=0 reuse. Also added assertions to detect its
	  return (the assertion catches in the existing test cases).

1 October 2007: Wouter
	- skip F77, CXX, objC tests in configure step.
	- fixup crash in refetch glue after a CNAME.
	  and protection against similar failures (with error print).

28 September 2007: Wouter
	- test case for unbound-checkconf, fixed so it also checks the
	  interface: statements.

26 September 2007: Wouter
	- SIGHUP will reopen the log file.
	- Option to log to syslog.
	- please lint, fixup tests (that went to syslog on open, oops).
	- config check program.

25 September 2007: Wouter
	- tests for NSEC3. Fixup bitmap checks for NSEC3.
	- positive ANY response needs to check if wildcard expansion, and
	  check that original data did not exist.
	- tests for NSEC3 that wrong use of OPTOUT is bad. For insecure
	  delegation, for abuse of child zone apex nsec3.
	- create 0.5 release tag.

24 September 2007: Wouter
	- do not make test programs by default.
	- But 'make test' will perform all of the tests.
	- Advertise builtin select libevent alternative when no libevent
	  is found.
	- signit can generate NSEC3 hashes, for generating tests.
	- multiple nsec3 paramaters in message test.
	- too high nsec3 iterations becomes insecure test.

21 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup empty_DS_name allocated in wrong region (port DEC Alpha).
	- fixup testcode lock safety (port FreeBSD).
	- removes subscript has type char warnings (port Solaris 9).
	- fixup of field with format type to int (port MacOS/X intel).
	- added test for infinite loop case in nonRD answer validation.
	  It was a more general problem, but hard to reproduce. When an
	  unsigned rrset is being validated and the key fetched, the DS
	  sequence is followed, but if the final name has no DS, then no
	  proof is possible - the signature has been stripped off.

20 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup and test for NSEC wildcard with empty nonterminals. 
	- makedist.sh fixup for svn info.
	- acl features request in plan.
	- improved DS empty nonterminal handling.
	- compat with ANS nxdomain for empty nonterminals. Attempts the nodata
	  proof anyway, which succeeds in ANS failure case.
	- striplab protection in case it becomes -1.
	- plans for static and blacklist config.

19 September 2007: Wouter
	- comments about non-packed usage.
	- plan for overload support in 0.6.
	- added testbound tests for a failed resolution from the logs
	  and for failed prime when missing glue.
	- fixup so useless delegation points are not returned from the
	  cache. Also the safety belt is used if priming fails to complete.
	- fixup NSEC rdata not to be lowercased, bind compat.

18 September 2007: Wouter
	- wildcard nsec3 testcases, and fixup to get correct wildcard name.
	- validator prints subtype classification for debug.

17 September 2007: Wouter
	- NSEC3 hash cache unit test.
	- validator nsec3 nameerror test.

14 September 2007: Wouter
	- nsec3 nodata proof, nods proof, wildcard proof.
	- nsec3 support for cname chain ending in noerror or nodata.
	- validator calls nsec3 proof routines if no NSECs prove anything.
	- fixup iterator bug where it stored the answer to a cname under
	  the wrong qname into the cache. When prepending the cnames, the
	  qname has to be reset to the original qname.

13 September 2007: Wouter
	- nsec3 find matching and covering, ce proof, prove namerror msg.

12 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup of manual page warnings, like for NSD bugreport.
	- nsec3 work, config, max iterations, filter, and hash cache. 

6 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup to find libevent on mac port install.
	- fixup size_t vs unsigned portability in validator/sigcrypt.
	- please compiler on different platforms, for unreachable code.
	- val_nsec3 file.
	- pthread_rwlock type is optional, in case of old pthread libs.

5 September 2007: Wouter
	- cname, name error validator tests.
	- logging of qtype ANY works.
	- ANY type answers get RRSIG in answer section of replies (but not
	  in other sections, unless DO bit is on).
	- testbound can replay a TCP query (set MATCH TCP in the QUERY).
	- DS and noDS referral validation test.
	- if you configure many trust anchors, parent trust anchors can
	  securely deny existance of child trust anchors, if validated.
	- not all *.name NSECs are present because a wildcard was matched,
	  and *.name NSECs can prove nodata for empty nonterminals.
	  Also, for wildcard name NSECs, check they are not from the parent
	  zone (for wildcarded zone cuts), and check absence of CNAME bit,
	  for a nodata proof.
	- configure option for memory allocation debugging.
	- port configure option for memory allocation to solaris10.

4 September 2007: Wouter
	- fixup of Leakage warning when serviced queries processed multiple
	  callbacks for the same query from the same server.
	- testbound removes config file from /tmp on failed exit.
	- fixup for referral cleanup of the additional section.
	- tests for cname, referral validation.
	- neater testbound tpkg output.
	- DNAMEs no longer match their apex when synthesized from the cache.
	- find correct signer name for DNAME responses.
	- wildcarded DNAME test and fixup code to detect.
	- prepend NSEC and NSEC3 rrsets in the iterator while chasing CNAMEs.
	  So that wildcarded CNAMEs get their NSEC with them to the answer.
	- test for a CNAME to a DNAME to a CNAME to an answer, all from
	  different domains, for key fetching and signature checking of
	  CNAME'd messages.

3 September 2007: Wouter
	- Fixed error in iterator that would cause assertion failure in 
	  validator. CNAME to a NXDOMAIN response was collated into a response
	  with both a CNAME and the NXDOMAIN rcode. Added a test that the
	  rcode is changed to NOERROR (because of the CNAME).
	- timeout on tcp does not lead to spurious leakage detect.
	- account memory for name of lame zones, so that memory leakages does
	  not show lame cache growth as a leakage growth.
	- config setting for lameness cache expressed in bytes, instead of
	  number of entries.
	- tool too summarize allocations per code line.

31 August 2007: Wouter
	- can read bind trusted-keys { ... }; files, in a compatibility mode. 
	- iterator should not detach target queries that it still could need.
	  the protection against multiple outstanding queries is moved to a
	  current_query num check.
	- validator nodata, positive, referral tests.
	- dname print can print '*' wildcard.

30 August 2007: Wouter
	- fixup override date config option.
	- config options to control memory usage.
	- caught bad free of un-alloced data in worker_send error case.
	- memory accounting for key cache (trust anchors and temporary cache).
	- memory accounting fixup for outside network tcp pending waits.
	- memory accounting fixup for outside network tcp callbacks.
	- memory accounting for iterator fixed storage.
	- key cache size and slabs config options.
	- lib crypto cleanups at exit. 

29 August 2007: Wouter
	- test tool to sign rrsets for testing validator with.
	- added RSA and DSA test keys, public and private pairs, 512 bits.
	- default configuration is with validation enabled.
	  Only a trust-anchor needs to be configured for DNSSEC to work.
	- do not convert to DER for DSA signature verification.
	- validator replay test file, for a DS to DNSKEY DSA key prime and
	  positive response.

28 August 2007: Wouter
	- removed double use for udp buffers, that could fail,
	  instead performs a malloc to do the backup.
	- validator validates referral messages, by validating all the rrsets
	  and stores the rrsets in the cache. Further referral (nonRD queries)
	  replies are made from the rrset cache directly. Unless unchecked
	  rrsets are encountered, there are then validated.
	- enforce that signing is done by a parent domain (or same domain).
	- adjust TTL downwards if rrset TTL bigger than signature allows.
	- permissive mode feature, sets AD bit for secure, but bogus does
	  not give servfail (bogus is changed into indeterminate).
	- optimization of rrset verification. rr canonical sorting is reused,
	  for the same rrset. canonical rrset image in buffer is reused for
	  the same signature.
	- if the rrset is too big (64k exactly + large owner name) the
	  canonicalization routine will fail if it does not fit in buffer.
	- faster verification for large sigsets.
	- verb_detail mode reports validation failures, but not the entire
	  algorithm for validation. Key prime failures are reported as 
	  verb_ops level.

27 August 2007: Wouter
	- do not garble the edns if a cache answer fails.
	- answer norecursive from cache if possible.
	- honor clean_additional setting when returning secure non-recursive
	  referrals.
	- do not store referral in msg cache for nonRD queries.
	- store verification status in the rrset cache to speed up future
	  verification.
	- mark rrsets indeterminate and insecure if they are found to be so.
	  and store this in the cache.

24 August 2007: Wouter
	- message is bogus if unsecure authority rrsets are present.
	- val-clean-additional option, so you can turn it off.
	- move rrset verification out of the specific proof types into one
	  routine. This makes the proof routines prettier.
	- fixup cname handling in validator, cname-to-positive and cname-to-
	  nodata work.
	- Do not synthesize DNSKEY and DS responses from the rrset cache if
	  the rrset is from the additional section. Signatures may have
	  fallen off the packet, and cause validation failure.
	- more verbose signature date errors (with the date attached).
	- increased default infrastructure cache size. It is important for
	  performance, and 1000 entries are only 212k (or a 400 k total cache
	  size). To 10000 entries (for 2M entries, 4M cache size).

23 August 2007: Wouter
	- CNAME handling - move needs_validation to before val_new().
	  val_new() setups the chase-reply to be an edited copy of the msg.
	  new classification, and find signer can find for it. 
	  removal of unsigned crap from additional, and query restart for
	  cname.
	- refuse to follow wildcarded DNAMEs when validating.
	  But you can query for qtype ANY, or qtype DNAME and validate that.

22 August 2007: Wouter
	- bogus TTL.
	- review - use val_error().

21 August 2007: Wouter
	- ANY response validation.
	- store security status in cache.
	- check cache security status and either send the query to be
	  validated, return the query to client, or send servfail to client.
	  Sets AD bit on validated replies.
	- do not examine security status on an error reply in mesh_done.
	- construct DS, DNSKEY messages from rrset cache.
	- manual page entry for override-date.

20 August 2007: Wouter
	- validate and positive validation, positive wildcard NSEC validation.
	- nodata validation, nxdomain validation.

18 August 2007: Wouter
	- process DNSKEY response in FINDKEY state.

17 August 2007: Wouter
	- work on DS2KE routine.
	- val_nsec.c for validator NSEC proofs.
	- unit test for NSEC bitmap reading.
	- dname iswild and canonical_compare with unit tests.

16 August 2007: Wouter
	- DS sig unit test.
	- latest release libevent 1.3c and 1.3d have threading fixed.
	- key entry fixup data pointer and ttl absolute.
	- This makes a key-prime succeed in validator, with DS or DNSKEY as
	  trust-anchor.
	- fixup canonical compare byfield routine, fix bug and also neater.
	- fixed iterator response type classification for queries of type
	  ANY and NS.
	  dig ANY gives sometimes NS rrset in AN and NS section, and parser
	  removes the NS section duplicate. dig NS gives sometimes the NS
	  in the answer section, as referral.
	- validator FINDKEY state.

15 August 2007: Wouter
	- crypto calls to verify signatures.
	- unit test for rrsig verification.

14 August 2007: Wouter
	- default outgoing ports changed to avoid port 2049 by default.
	  This port is widely blocked by firewalls.
	- count infra lameness cache in memory size.
	- accounting of memory improved
	- outbound entries are allocated in the query region they are for.
	- extensive debugging for memory allocations.
	- --enable-lock-checks can be used to enable lock checking.
	- protect undefs in config.h from autoheaders ministrations.
	- print all received udp packets. log hex will print on multiple
	  lines if needed.
	- fixed error in parser with backwards rrsig references.
	- mark cycle targets for iterator did not have CD flag so failed
	  its task.

13 August 2007: Wouter
	- fixup makefile, if lexer is missing give nice error and do not
	  mess up the dependencies.
	- canonical compare routine updated.
	- canonical hinfo compare.
	- printout list of the queries that the mesh is working on.

10 August 2007: Wouter
	- malloc and free overrides that track total allocation and frees.
	  for memory debugging.
	- work on canonical sort.

9 August 2007: Wouter
	- canonicalization, signature checks
	- dname signature label count and unit test.
	- added debug heap size print to memory printout.
	- typo fixup in worker.c
	- -R needed on solaris.
	- validator override option for date check testing.

8 August 2007: Wouter
	- ldns _raw routines created (in ldns trunk).
	- sigcrypt DS digest routines
	- val_utils uses sigcrypt to perform signature cryptography.
	- sigcrypt keyset processing

7 August 2007: Wouter
	- security status type.
	- security status is copied when rdata is equal for rrsets.
	- rrset id is updated to invalidate all the message cache entries
	  that refer to NSEC, NSEC3, DNAME rrsets that have changed.
	- val_util work
	- val_sigcrypt file for validator signature checks.

6 August 2007: Wouter
	- key cache for validator.
	- moved isroot and dellabel to own dname routines, with unit test.

3 August 2007: Wouter
	- replanning.
	- scrubber check section of lame NS set.
	- trust anchors can be in config file or read from zone file,
	  DS and DNSKEY entries.
	- unit test trust anchor storage.
	- trust anchors converted to packed rrsets.
	- key entry definition.

2 August 2007: Wouter
	- configure change for latest libevent trunk version (needs -lrt).
	- query_done and walk_supers are moved out of module interface.
	- fixup delegation point duplicates.
	- fixup iterator scrubber; lame NS set is let through the scrubber
	  so that the classification is lame.
	- validator module exists, and does nothing but pass through,
	  with calling of next module and return.
	- validator work.

1 August 2007: Wouter
	- set version to 0.5
	- module work for module to module interconnections.
	- config of modules.
	- detect cycle takes flags.

31 July 2007: Wouter
	- updated plan
	- release 0.4 tag.

30 July 2007: Wouter
	- changed random state init, so that sequential process IDs are not
	  cancelled out by sequential thread-ids in the random number seed.
	- the fwd_three test, which sends three queries to unbound, and 
	  unbound is kept waiting by ldns-testns for 3 seconds, failed
	  because the retry timeout for default by unbound is 3 seconds too,
	  it would hit that timeout and fail the test. Changed so that unbound
	  is kept waiting for 2 seconds instead.

27 July 2007: Wouter
	- removed useless -C debug option. It did not work.
	- text edit of documentation.
	- added doc/CREDITS file, referred to by the manpages.
	- updated planning.

26 July 2007: Wouter
	- cycle detection, for query state dependencies. Will attempt to
	  circumvent the cycle, but if no other targets available fails.
	- unit test for AXFR, IXFR response.
	- test for cycle detection.

25 July 2007: Wouter
	- testbound read ADDRESS and check it.
	- test for version.bind and friends.
	- test for iterator chaining through several referrals.
	- test and fixup for refetch for glue. Refetch fails if glue
	  is still not provided.

24 July 2007: Wouter
	- Example section in config manual.
	- Addr stored for range and moment in replay.

20 July 2007: Wouter
	- Check CNAME chain before returning cache entry with CNAMEs.
	- Option harden-glue, default is on. It will discard out of zone
	  data. If disabled, performance is faster, but spoofing attempts
	  become a possibility. Note that still normalize scrubbing is done,
	  and that the potentially spoofed data is used for infrastructure
	  and not returned to the client.
	- if glue times out, refetch by asking parent of delegation again.
	  Much like asking for DS at the parent side.
	- TODO items from forgery-resilience draft.
	  and on memory handling improvements.
	- renamed module_event_timeout to module_event_noreply.
	- memory reporting code; reports on memory usage after handling
	  a network packet (not on cache replies).

19 July 2007: Wouter
	- shuffle NS selection when getting nameserver target addresses.
	- fixup of deadlock warnings, yield cpu in checklock code so that
	  freebsd scheduler selects correct process to run.
	- added identity and version config options and replies.
	- store cname messages complete answers.

18 July 2007: Wouter
	- do not query addresses, 127.0.0.1, and ::1 by default.

17 July 2007: Wouter
	- forward zone options in config file.
	- forward per zone in iterator. takes precendence over stubs.
	- fixup commithooks.
	- removed forward-to and forward-to-port features, subsumed by
	  new forward zones.
	- fix parser to handle absent server: clause.
	- change untrusted rrset test to account for scrubber that is now
	  applied during the test (which removes the poison, by the way).
	- feature, addresses can be specified with @portnumber, like nsd.conf.
	- test config files changed over to new forwarder syntax.

27 June 2007: Wouter
	- delete of mesh does a postorder traverse of the tree.
	- found and fixed a memory leak. For TTL=0 messages, that would
	  not be cached, instead the msg-replyinfo structure was leaked.
	- changed server selection so it will filter out hosts that are
	  unresponsive. This is defined as a host with the maximum rto value.
	  This means that unbound tried the host for retries up to 120 secs.
	  The rto value will time out after host-ttl seconds from the cache.
	  This keeps such unresolvable queries from taking up resources.
	- utility for keeping histogram.

26 June 2007: Wouter
	- mesh is called by worker, and iterator uses it.
	  This removes the hierarchical code.
	  QueryTargets state and Finished state are merged for iterator.
	- forwarder mode no longer sets AA bit on first reply.
	- rcode in walk_supers is not needed.

25 June 2007: Wouter
	- more mesh work.
	- error encode routine for ease.

22 June 2007: Wouter
	- removed unused _node iterator value from rbtree_t. Takes up space.
	- iterator can handle querytargets state without a delegation point
	  set, so that a priming(stub) subquery error can be handled.
	- iterator stores if it is priming or not.
	- log_query_info() neater logging.
	- changed iterator so that it does not alter module_qstate.qinfo
	  but keeps a chase query info. Also query_flags are not altered,
	  the iterator uses chase_flags.
	- fixup crash in case no ports for the family exist.

21 June 2007: Wouter
	- Fixup secondary buffer in case of error callback.
	- cleanup slumber list of runnable states.
	- module_subreq_depth fails to work in slumber list.
	- fixup query release for cached results to sub targets.
	- neater error for tcp connection failure, shows addr in verbose.
	- rbtree_init so that it can be used with preallocated memory.

20 June 2007: Wouter
	- new -C option to enable coredumps after forking away.
	- doc update.
	- fixup CNAME generation by scrubber, and memory allocation of it.
	- fixup deletion of serviced queries when all callbacks delete too.
	- set num target queries to 0 when you move them to slumber list.
	- typo in check caused subquery errors to be ignored, fixed.
	- make lint happy about rlim_t.
	- freeup of modules after freeup of module-states.
	- duplicate replies work, this uses secondary udp buffer in outnet.

19 June 2007: Wouter
	- nicer layout in stats.c, review 0.3 change.
	- spelling improvement, review 0.3 change.
	- uncapped timeout for server selection, so that very fast or slow
	  servers will stand out from the rest.
	- target-fetch-policy: "3 2 1 0 0" config setting.
	- fixup queries answered without RD bit (for root prime results).
	- refuse AXFR and IXFR requests.
	- fixup RD flag in error reply from iterator. fixup RA flag from
	  worker error reply.
	- fixup encoding of very short edns buffer sizes, now sets TC bit.
	- config options harden-short-bufsize and harden-large-queries.

18 June 2007: Wouter
	- same, move subqueries to slumber list when first has resolved.
	- fixup last fix for duplicate callbacks.
	- another offbyone in targetcounter. Also in Java prototype by the way.

15 June 2007: Wouter
	- if a query asks to be notified of the same serviced query result
	  multiple times, this will succeed. Only one callback will happen;
	  multiple outbound-list entries result (but the double cleanup of it
	  will not matter).
	- when iterator moves on due to CNAME or referral, it will remove
	  the subqueries (for other targets). These are put on the slumber
	  list.
	- state module wait subq is OK with no new subqs, an old one may have
	  stopped, with an error, and it is still waiting for other ones.
	- if a query loops, halt entire query (easy way to clean up properly).

14 June 2007: Wouter
	- num query targets was > 0 , not >= 0 compared, so that fetch
	  policy of 0 did nothing.

13 June 2007: Wouter
	- debug option: configure --enable-static-exe for compile where
	  ldns and libevent are linked statically. Default is off.
	- make install and make uninstall. Works with static-exe and without.
	  installation of unbound binary and manual pages.
	- alignement problem fix on solaris 64.
	- fixup address in case of TCP error.

12 June 2007: Wouter
	- num target queries was set to 0 at a bad time. Default it to 0 and
	  increase as target queries are done.
	- synthesize CNAME and DNAME responses from the cache.
	- Updated doxygen config for doxygen 1.5.
	- aclocal newer version.
	- doxygen 1.5 fixes for comments (for the strict check on docs).

11 June 2007: Wouter
	- replies on TCP queries have the address field set in replyinfo,
	  for serviced queries, because the initiator does not know that
	  a TCP fallback has occured.
	- omit DNSSEC types from nonDO replies, except if qtype is ANY or
	  if qtype directly queries for the type (and then only show that
	  'unknown type' in the answer section).
	- fixed message parsing where rrsigs on their own would be put
	  in the signature list over the rrsig type.

7 June 2007: Wouter
	- fixup error in double linked list insertion for subqueries and
	  for outbound list of serviced queries for iterator module.
	- nicer printout of outgoing port selection. 
	- fixup cname target readout.
	- nicer debug output.
	- fixup rrset counts when prepending CNAMEs to the answer.
	- fixup rrset TTL for prepended CNAMEs.
	- process better check for looping modules, and which submodule to
	  run next.
	- subreq insertion code fixup for slumber list.
	- VERB_DETAIL, verbosity: 2 level gives short but readable output.
	  VERB_ALGO, verbosity: 3 gives extensive output.
	- fixup RA bit in cached replies.
	- fixup CNAME responses from the cache no longer partial response.
	- error in network send handled without leakage.
	- enable ip6 from config, and try ip6 addresses if available,
	  if ip6 is not connected, skips to next server.

	- iterator state finished.
	- subrequests without parent store in cache and stop.
	- worker slumber list for ongoing promiscuous queries.
	- subrequest error handling.
	- priming failure returns SERVFAIL.
	- priming gives LAME result, returns SERVFAIL.
	- debug routine to print dns_msg as handled by iterator.
	- memleak in config file stubs fixup.
	- more small bugs, in scrubber, query compare no ID for lookup,
	  in dname validation for NS targets.
	- sets entry.key for new special allocs.
	- lognametypeclass can display unknown types and classes.

4 June 2007: Wouter
	- random selection of equally preferred nameserver targets.
	- reply info copy routine. Reuses existing code.
	- cache lameness in response handling.
	- do not touch qstate after worker_process_query because it may have
	  been deleted by that routine.
	- Prime response state.
	- Process target response state.
	- some memcmp changed to dname_compare for case preservation.

1 June 2007: Wouter
	- normalize incoming messages. Like unbound-java, with CNAME chain
	  checked, DNAME checked, CNAME's synthesized, glue checked.
	- sanitize incoming messages.
	- split msgreply encode functions into own file msgencode.c.
	- msg_parse to queryinfo/replyinfo conversion more versatile.

31 May 2007: Wouter
	- querytargets state.
	- dname_subdomain_c() routine.
	- server selection, based on RTT. ip6 is filtered out if not available,
	  and lameness is checked too.
	- delegation point copy routine.

30 May 2007: Wouter
	- removed FLAG_CD from message and rrset caches. This was useful for
	  an agnostic forwarder, but not for a sophisticated (trust value per
	  rrset enabled) cache.
	- iterator reponse typing.
	- iterator cname handle.
	- iterator prime start.
	- subquery work.
	- processInitRequest and processInitRequest2.
	- cache synthesizes referral messages, with DS and NSEC.
	- processInitRequest3.
	- if a request creates multiple subrequests these are all activated.

29 May 2007: Wouter
	- routines to lock and unlock array of rrsets moved to cache/rrset.
	- lookup message from msg cache (and copy to region).

	- services/cache/dns.c DNS Cache. Hybrid cache uses msgcache and
	  rrset cache from module environment.

	  members. They are still kept in network format for fast msg encode.
	- dns cache find_delegation routine.
	- iterator main functions setup.
	- dns cache lookup setup.

24 May 2007: Wouter
	- small changes to prepare for subqueries.
	- iterator forwarder feature separated out.
	- iterator hints stub code, config file stub code, so that first
	  testing can proceed locally.
	- replay tests now have config option to enable forwarding mode.

23 May 2007: Wouter
	- outside network does precise timers for roundtrip estimates for rtt
	  and for setting timeout for UDP. Pending_udp takes milliseconds.

	- testns test for EDNS fallback, test for TCP fallback already exists.
	- fixes for no-locking compile.
	- mini_event timer precision and fix for change in timeouts during
	  timeout callback. Fix for fwd_three tests, performed nonexit query.

21 May 2007: Wouter

	- outside network serviced queries, contain edns and tcp fallback,
	  and udp retries and rtt timing.

	- compiletests: fixed empty body ifstatements in alloc.c, in case
	  locks are disabled.

8 May 2007: Wouter
	- outgoing network keeps list of available tcp buffers for outgoing 
	  tcp queries.
	- outgoing-num-tcp config option.
	- outgoing network keeps waiting list of queries waiting for buffer.
	- netevent supports outgoing tcp commpoints, nonblocking connects.

7 May 2007: Wouter
	- EDNS read from query, used to make reply smaller.
	- advertised edns value constants.
	- EDNS BADVERS response, if asked for too high edns version.
	- EDNS extended error reponses once the EDNS record from the query
	  has successfully been parsed.

4 May 2007: Wouter
	- msgreply sizefunc is more accurate.
	- config settings for rrset cache size and slabs.
	- hashtable insert takes argument so that a thread can use its own
	  alloc cache to store released keys.
	- alloc cache special_release() locks if necessary.
	- rrset trustworthiness type added.
	- thread keeps a scratchpad region for handling messages.
	- writev used in netevent to write tcp length and data after another.
	  This saves a roundtrip on tcp replies.
	- test for one rrset updated in the cache.
	- test for one rrset which is not updated, as it is not deemed
	  trustworthy enough.

2 May 2007: Wouter
	- dname unit tests in own file and spread out neatly in functions.
	- more dname unit tests.
	- message encoding creates truncated TC flagged messages if they do 
	  not fit, and will leave out (whole)rrsets from additional if needed.

1 May 2007: Wouter
	- decompress query section, extremely lenient acceptance.
	  But only for answers from other servers, not for plain queries.
	- compression and decompression test cases.
	- some stats added.
	- example.conf interface: line is changed from 127.0.0.1 which leads
	  to problems if used (restricting communication to the localhost),
	  to a documentation and test address.

27 April 2007: Wouter
	- removed iov usage, it is not good for dns message encoding.
	- owner name compression more optimal.

		* dname_pkt_copy forgot to read next label length.
	- test from file and fixes
		* double frees fixed in error conditions.
		* types with less than full rdata allowed by parser.
		  Some dynamic update packets seem to use it.

	- detect sign of msghdr.msg_iovlen so that the cast to that type
	  in netevent (which is there to please lint) can be correct.
	  The type on several OSes ranges from int, int32, uint32, size_t.
	  Detects unsigned or signed using math trick.
	- constants for DNS flags. 
	- compilation without locks fixup.
	- removed include of unportable header from lookup3.c.
	- more portable use of struct msghdr.
	- casts for printf warning portability.
	- tweaks to tests to port them to the testbed.
	- 0.2 tag created.

2 April 2007: Wouter
	- check sizes of udp received messages, not too short.
	- review changes. Some memmoves can be memcpys: 4byte aligned.
	  set id correctly on cached answers. 
	- review changes msgreply.c, memleak on error condition. AA flag
	  clear on cached reply. Lowercase queries on hashing.
	  unit test on lowercasing. Test AA bit not set on cached reply.
	  Note that no TTLs are managed.

29 March 2007: Wouter
	- writev or sendmsg used when answering from cache.
	  This avoids a copy of the data.
	- do not do useless byteswap on query id. Store reply flags in uint16
	  for easier access (and no repeated byteswapping).
	- reviewed code.
	- configure detects and config.h includes sys/uio.h for writev decl.

28 March 2007: Wouter
	- new config option: num-queries-per-thread.
	- added tpkg test for answering three queries at the same time
	  using one thread (from the query service list).

27 March 2007: Wouter
	- added test for cache and not cached answers, in testbound replays.
	- testbound can give config file and commandline options from the
	  replay file to unbound.
	- created test that checks if items drop out of the cache.
	- added word 'partitioned hash table' to documentation on slab hash.
	  A slab hash is a partitioned hash table.
	- worker can handle multiple queries at a time.

26 March 2007: Wouter
	- config settings for slab hash message cache.
	- test for cached answer.
	- Fixup deleting fake answer from testbound list.

23 March 2007: Wouter
	- review of yesterday's commits.
	- covered up memory leak of the entry locks.
	- answers from the cache correctly. Copies flags correctly.
	- sanity check for incoming query replies.
	- slabbed hash table. Much nicer contention, need dual cpu to see.

22 March 2007: Wouter
	- AIX configure check.
	- lock-verify can handle references to locks that are created
	  in files it has not yet read in.
	- threaded hash table test. 
	- unit test runs lock-verify afterwards and checks result.
	- need writelock to update data on hash_insert.
	- message cache code, msgreply code.

21 March 2007: Wouter
	- unit test of hash table, fixup locking problem in table_grow().
	- fixup accounting of sizes for removing items from hashtable.
	- unit test for hash table, single threaded test of integrity.
	- lock-verify reports errors nicely. More quiet in operation.

16 March 2007: Wouter
	- lock-verifier, checks consistent order of locking.

14 March 2007: Wouter
	- hash table insert (and subroutines) and lookup implemented.
	- hash table remove.
	- unit tests for hash internal bin, lru functions.

13 March 2007: Wouter
	- lock_unprotect in checklocks.
	- util/storage/lruhash.h for LRU hash table structure.

12 March 2007: Wouter
	- configure.ac moved to 0.2.
	- query_info and replymsg util/data structure.

9 March 2007: Wouter
	- added rwlock writelock checking.
	  So it will keep track of the writelock, and readlocks are enforced
	  to not change protected memory areas.
	- log_hex function to dump hex strings to the logfile.
	- checklocks zeroes its destroyed lock after checking memory areas.
	- unit test for alloc.
	- identifier for union in checklocks to please older compilers.
	- created 0.1 tag.

8 March 2007: Wouter
	- Reviewed checklock code.

7 March 2007: Wouter
	- created a wrapper around thread calls that performs some basic
	  checking for data race and deadlock, and basic performance 
	  contention measurement.

6 March 2007: Wouter
	- Testbed works with threading (different machines, different options).
	- alloc work, does the special type.

2 March 2007: Wouter
	- do not compile fork funcs unless needed. Otherwise will give
	  type errors as their typedefs have not been enabled.
	- log shows thread numbers much more nicely (and portably).
	- even on systems with nonthreadsafe libevent signal handling,
	  unbound will exit if given a signal.
	  Reloads will not work, and exit is not graceful.
	- start of alloc framework layout.

1 March 2007: Wouter
	- Signals, libevent and threads work well, with libevent patch and
	  changes to code (close after event_del).
	- set ipc pipes nonblocking.

27 February 2007: Wouter
	- ub_thread_join portable definition.
	- forking is used if no threading is available.
	  Tested, it works, since pipes work across processes as well.
	  Thread_join is replaced with waitpid. 
	- During reloads the daemon will temporarily handle signals,
	  so that they do not result in problems.
	- Also randomize the outgoing port range for tests.
	- If query list is full, will stop selecting listening ports for read.
	  This makes all threads service incoming requests, instead of one.
	  No memory is leaking during reloads, service of queries, etc.
	- test that uses ldns-testns -f to test threading. Have to answer
	  three queries at the same time.
	- with verbose=0 operates quietly.

26 February 2007: Wouter
	- ub_random code used to select ID and port.
	- log code prints thread id.
	- unbound can thread itself, with reload(HUP) and quit working
	  correctly.
	- don't open pipes for #0, doesn't need it.
	- listens to SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT (all quit) and SIGHUP (reload).

23 February 2007: Wouter
	- Can do reloads on sigHUP. Everything is stopped, and freed,
	  except the listening ports. Then the config file is reread.
	  And everything is started again (and listening ports if needed).
	- Ports for queries are shared.
	- config file added interface:, chroot: and username:.
	- config file: directory, logfile, pidfile. And they work too.
	- will daemonize by default now. Use -d to stay in the foreground.
	- got BSD random[256 state] code, made it threadsafe. util/random.

22 February 2007: Wouter
	- Have a config file. Removed commandline options, moved to config.

	- put include errno.h in config.h

19 February 2007: Wouter
	- Created 0.0 svn tag.
	- added acx_pthread.m4 autoconf check for pthreads from 
	  the autoconf archive. It is GPL-with-autoconf-exception Licensed.
	  You can specify --with-pthreads, or --without-pthreads to configure.

16 February 2007: Wouter
	- Updated testbed script, works better by using make on remote end.
	- removed check decls, we can compile without them.
	- makefile supports LIBOBJ replacements.
	- docs checks ignore compat code.
	- added util/mini-event.c and .h, a select based alternative used with
	  ./configure --with-libevent=no
	  It is limited to 1024 file descriptors, and has less features.
	- will not create ip6 sockets if ip6 not on the machine.

15 February 2007: Wouter
	- port to FreeBSD 4.11 Dec Alpha. Also works on Solaris 10 sparc64,
	  Solaris 9, FreeBSD 6, Linux i386 and OSX powerpc.
	- malloc rndstate, so that it is aligned for access.
	- fixed rbtree cleanup with postorder traverse.
	- fixed pending messages are deleted when handled.
	- You can control verbosity; default is not verbose, every -v
	  adds more verbosity.

14 February 2007: Wouter
	- Included configure.ac changes from ldns.
	- detect (some) headers before the standards check.
	- do not use isblank to test c99, since its not available on solaris9.
	- review of testcode.

	  it checks the logfiles to see if servers have come up. Takes 0.14s.
	- set addrlen value when calling recvfrom.
	- comparison of addrs more portable.
	- LIBEVENT option for testbed to set libevent directory.
